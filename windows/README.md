## Mapping CapsLock to Control

Can be done with Windows powertoys keyboard manager, but I think I did the regedit solution here https://zachrussell.net/blog/map-caps-lock-to-control-windows/ since it persists in admin situations
Powertoys only works in User situation, so it reverts to capslock in admin terminals, task manager, etc

# Installed

- PowerToys for Keyboard manager
- Powershell 7.5 ( choco install powershell-core â€“force)
- Windows terminal
- Chocolatey
- Vs Code
- Persistent Windows -sorta worked, but not needed if no multimonitor setup probably?
- Scoop
- sudo for windows - https://smalltech.com.au/blog/sudo-for-windows
- Fluent Terminal for a little better quake mode?? - need sudo for windows as no good way to start in admin mode
- PoshGit - TTD version was too old and didnt work with new Powershell
- k9s for kubernetes (choco install k9s)
- ripgrip - scoop install ripgrip
