# About
Themr allows you to quickly change your UI theme with keyboard shortcuts and the command palette. With Themr, you get commands to easily cycle forward, backward and randomly through your available themes.

# Features
* Full compatibility with Sublime Text 2 and 3.
* Automatically loads all available `.sublime-theme` files, including those found inside `.sublime-package` files. No need to restart Sublime Text or initiate a reload!

# Author's Note
When changing to or from some themes, Sublime Text may need be restarted to fully clear the old theme settings and apply the new theme settings.

# Installation
Install Schemr through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) or download and extract it into your Packages folder.
