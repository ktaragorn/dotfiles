# Grub
 
Change size by /etc/default/grub

GRUB_GFXMODE to known value from videoinfo in grub console (grub -> escape)

Change default by setting GRUB_DEFAULT to name from /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Can modify /boot/grub/themes/x/themes.txt to change grub

Need to run update-grub after making changes.

To install grub in efi mode in feren os, need to boot live cd as EFI mode and go from there
